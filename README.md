# Northcoders News Web App

[Live Web App](https://philtbatt-ncnews.netlify.app/)

NC News is a full-stack news application where users can browse and read articles on various topics, filter by category, and sort by different criteria. The app provides users with an interface to explore content, view comments, and interact with articles. It uses the backend project I made here: [Northcoders News API](https://github.com/PhilTBatt/be-nc-news)
